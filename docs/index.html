		<h1>Encountr</h1>
		<h3>As you can tell, heavily under construction</h3>
		<p>This page will house information about Encountr in the future. This website is very barebones right now since I am focusing on Encountr right now and will make this page when Encountr is ready.</p>
		<p>The main purpose of this website currently is to host definitions to use with Encountr.</p>
